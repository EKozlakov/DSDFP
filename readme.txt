Hello!

If you're reading this, this means you must be in my repository for my
"Digital System Design" course, also known as "CPE-487." This repository
will mainly be used to store vhdl files I'll be making for this class, and
also to serve as evidence of my work. Take some time troll around and check
it out if you're interested.

-Gene.
